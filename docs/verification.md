# Verification plan

How we check that the acceptance criteria in [project-brief.md](project-brief.md) hold. Commands are in [CLAUDE.md](../CLAUDE.md).

## Test levels and why

| Level | Tool | Used for | Why |
|---|---|---|---|
| Unit | Vitest | zod schema, navigation data | Fast, no UI or database needed |
| Data | Vitest + in-memory SQLite per test | `createTicket`, `listTickets` | Real queries against a real schema, isolated and fast |
| Server action | Vitest | `submitTicket` | Checks validation, saving, revalidation and redirect without a browser |
| Component | Vitest + React Testing Library | `TicketForm`, `TicketList`, `PortalShell` | Checks labels, errors and states the user sees |
| End-to-end | Playwright (Chrome) against a production build and `data/e2e.db` | Full flows, keyboard navigation, async Server Components | Async Server Components cannot be unit-tested with Vitest |

## Criterion to test mapping

| Criterion | Tests |
|---|---|
| AC1.1 | `submitTicket` saves a valid ticket and redirects; `createTicket` stores status open; e2e "submitting a valid ticket shows it at the top of the list" |
| AC1.2 | `newTicketSchema` defaults priority and rejects unknown priorities |
| AC1.3 | `newTicketSchema` optional email; `submitTicket` invalid email and no email; e2e invalid email |
| AC1.4 | `submitTicket` returns errors and values; `TicketForm` shows errors and keeps values; e2e short subject |
| AC1.5 | `newTicketSchema` trimming, limits and required name |
| AC1.6 | `newTicketSchema` strips unknown fields; `submitTicket` ignores a status |
| AC2.1 | `TicketList` renders a row per ticket; e2e list shows requester |
| AC2.2 | `listTickets` newest first; e2e newest first |
| AC2.3 | `TicketList` empty state |
| AC3.1, AC3.2 | `PortalShell`, `navItems`; e2e redirect and keyboard navigation |
| AC4.x, AC5.x | Not built, no tests yet |

## Latest run results

Run on 2026-10-30 on branch `marie/spec-improvements`.

| Command | Result |
|---|---|
| `npm test` | 7 files, 31 tests passed |
| `npm run lint` | No errors |
| `npm run typecheck` | No errors |
| `npm run test:e2e` | 6 tests passed |

Update this table when you rerun the checks.

## Limitations of the verification

- No tests for AC4.x and AC5.x because the features are not built.
- End-to-end tests cover Chrome only.
- No accessibility audit beyond the keyboard navigation test and labelled form fields.
- e2e tests share one seeded database, so they depend on the seed data order.
