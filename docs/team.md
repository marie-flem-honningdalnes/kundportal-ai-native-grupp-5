## Working agreement

We share responsibility for the Customer Service Portal (Kundserviceportalen) across the 4-week examination period.

- **Shared ownership.** Every member can read, run, and explain the whole codebase. Components have a named owner (see below), but no one works in isolation.
- **One fork, one `main`.** We work in the team fork. Smaller tasks go on short-lived branches and are reviewed in internal PRs to our own `main`. The continuous PR from fork `main` to the course repo `main` stays open and is not merged.
- **Traceable reviews.** Each internal PR records who reviewed it, what was checked, and what changed as a result.
- **Weekly status.** We update `docs/status/week-N.md` each week with what was planned, completed, verified, uncertain, and next.
- **AI use.** AI agents may draft code, tests, and docs, but a human owns and reviews every change. We record which tasks involved an AI agent and what was verified by hand.
- **Fake data only.** No real customer data in the repo, in seeds, or in prompts.
- **Communication.** Blockers are raised early. Decisions that affect the architecture are written down in a new md-file for each descision `docs/decisions/` Decisions should follow structure in `docs/decisions/README.md` .

## Requirements and responsibility

The solution requirements from the examination assignment. Proposal: to be confirmed by the team.

Each member owns at least one traceable technical requirement and reviews at least one classmate's change. Every owner writes the automated tests for their own requirement.

| Requirement | Owner | Reviewer |
|---|---|---|
| Register a new ticket and validate required information | Alexandra Petersson | Jessica Swahn |
| Handle at least one invalid use case with a clear message to the user | Alexandra Petersson | Jessica Swahn |
| Persist tickets so they remain after the application restarts | Ariadna Villar | Marie Flem Honningdalnes |
| Show a list of tickets and the details of a selected ticket | Marie Flem Honningdalnes | Alexandra Petersson |
| Change the status of a ticket | Jessica Swahn | Ariadna Villar |
| Verify central behaviour with automated tests covering happy paths and relevant error paths | Jessica Swahn | Ariadna Villar |
| Can be run and demonstrated by someone else using our instructions | Ariadna Villar | Marie Flem Honningdalnes |
