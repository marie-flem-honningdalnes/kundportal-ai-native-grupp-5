# Kundserviceportalen

Kundserviceportalen is a customer service portal where case handlers register support tickets on behalf of customers who contact support by phone or in writing, and follow the tickets through a workflow with status updates. It is a local-first app built with Next.js 16, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, SQLite (libSQL) and Drizzle ORM, using fake customer data only.

Quickstart and commands are in the app section below.

---

### Requirements

- Node.js 24 or later (`.nvmrc` pins the major version)
- Google Chrome, for the end-to-end tests run locally

### Getting started

```bash
npm install
cp .env.example .env.local   # optional; the defaults use ./data/dev.db
npm run db:reset             # create, migrate and seed the local database
npm run dev
```

Then open http://localhost:3000.

There's no sign-in yet: anyone who opens the app is treated as a case handler and sees every ticket.

### Commands

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `npm run dev` | Start the development server |
| `npm run build` / `npm run start` | Build for production / serve the build |
| `npm run lint` | Run ESLint |
| `npm run typecheck` | Generate route types, then check types with TypeScript |
| `npm test` | Run unit and component tests once (Vitest) |
| `npm run test:watch` | Run Vitest in watch mode while you develop |
| `npm run test:e2e` | Reset a separate `data/e2e.db`, build, and run the Playwright tests |
| `npm run db:generate` | Create a migration in `drizzle/` from changes to `src/db/schema.ts` |
| `npm run db:migrate` | Apply migrations to `DATABASE_URL` |
| `npm run db:seed` | Insert demo tickets |
| `npm run db:reset` | Delete the local database file, then migrate and seed (local files only) |

### Test-driven development

Every change starts with a failing test:

1. **Red:** write a test that describes the behaviour, then run it and watch it fail for the right reason.
2. **Green:** write the least code that makes it pass.
3. **Refactor:** tidy up with the tests still green.

Where each kind of test goes:

- **Unit and component tests** (Vitest + React Testing Library) sit next to the code as `*.test.ts(x)`. Database tests run against a fresh in-memory SQLite per test (`src/test-utils/testDb.ts`) and use `// @vitest-environment node`.
- **End-to-end tests** (Playwright) live in `e2e/`. They run against a production build and a freshly seeded `data/e2e.db`. Async Server Components can't be unit-tested with Vitest, so cover them here.
